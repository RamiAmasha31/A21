The system doesnt need any login informations.
For the reservations and private events forms it check directly if we have empty slot in DB and alerts the user directly with no need to be approved from any manger.
Currently working on admin role that enables the admin to edit the content in the website. ( cahnging prices, adding items, deleting items...).
As a DB for now we used local directory named models that have all the data as json files.
